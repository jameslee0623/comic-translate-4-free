Translate manga & comic pages in your browser. AI detects bubbles, reads text, and re-renders translations in place — all on-device.

(Count: 128)

## Detailed description

**Read manga in your language — right in the browser.**

comic-translate-4-free translates comic and manga pages automatically as you
browse. Open a page, and the translated version replaces the original image
in place — speech bubbles filled with your language, nothing to click.

**How it works**

1. The extension finds the page's main image and captures it.
2. An on-device AI detector locates every speech bubble and text block.
3. Manga-trained OCR reads the text (Japanese, English, Simplified and
   Traditional Chinese — with automatic language detection).
4. The original text is cleanly removed with AI inpainting.
5. Your choice of translation engine renders the result back into the
   bubbles, sized to fit.

**Privacy-first: the AI runs on your machine**

Bubble detection, OCR, and inpainting all run locally in your browser via
WebAssembly — your pages never leave your device. Only the extracted text
is sent to the translation service you choose.
