## ✨ Features

- **Automatic translation** — open a manga page on an allowed site and the translated version appears in place, no button click needed.
- **Right-click any image** — choose "Send to comic-translate-4-free" to translate a specific picture, even one smaller than the minimum size.
- **114 target languages** via Google Translate, Azure Translator, or your own local LM Studio server.
- **Source language auto-detect** — Japanese, English, Simplified/Traditional Chinese identified automatically from the OCR'd text.
- **Long-strip / webtoon support** — tall pages are processed in overlapping segments so text stays sharp.
- **16 UI languages** — the extension interface follows your browser's language setting.

### 🔒 Privacy

- **The AI runs on your machine.** Bubble detection, OCR, and inpainting all execute locally in your browser via WebAssembly. Your pages never leave your device.
- **Only translated text is sent out** — just the extracted strings go to the translation service you choose (Google / Azure / your local LM Studio).
- **No account, no tracking, no telemetry.** All settings and cached models stay in your browser's local storage.

## 🚀 Installation

**Chrome / Edge / Brave:**

[**Install from the Chrome Web Store**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pndooikgcenncdohfggodonniihplppj) — one click, automatic updates.

**Firefox:** download the Firefox zip from [Releases](https://github.com/jameslee0623/comic-translate-4-free/releases), then go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` → **Load Temporary Add-on** → pick `manifest.json`. (Temporary add-ons unload on restart; a signed AMO listing is in progress.)

After installing, open the Settings page and click **Download all models** once (~350 MB: detector, OCR, inpainter). They're cached in the browser and verified by byte size.

## 💡 How to Use

1. **Allow the site first** — click the extension icon and press **Allow this site** (or enable **ALLOW ALL SITES**). Translation only runs where you've granted permission.

   ![Allow the site from the popup](docs/images/popup.png)

2. **Reload the manga page** — it starts translating automatically when the page loads. A pill in the top-right shows live progress (Capturing → Detecting → OCR → …).
3. **Done** — the page's picture is replaced in place with the translated version.

**Tips:**
- Right-click any image → **Send to comic-translate-4-free** to translate just that picture.

  ![Right-click to send an image](docs/images/right-click.png)

- If a site blocks downloads (HTTP 403), the extension automatically retries via a background tab.
- Pick your translation engine in Settings: Google (free, no key), Azure Translator (apply for keys below — 2M characters/month free), or LM Studio (local server).
- Enable **Debug mode** in Settings to inspect every pipeline stage.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- **No Korean OCR yet** — source languages are Japanese, English, and Simplified/Traditional Chinese. (Korean remains available as a translation target.)
- **One picture per page** for auto-translate (the page's main image). Use right-click → Send to translate others.
- **Large sessions** — translating dozens of images in one session can crash the browser. Clear the page cache in Settings if this happens.
- **Firefox** — models run in the background page (no offscreen documents), sharing memory with everything else. Restart the browser if you see "no available backend found".
- Google Translate uses the unofficial free endpoint and may be rate-limited.

## 📄 Third-party notices

This project is inspired by [ogkalu2/comic-translate](https://github.com/ogkalu2/comic-translate) — the bubble/text detector and the manga-finetuned LaMa inpainter are its ONNX exports, and the inference logic is ported from it. (OCR uses [Baberu](https://huggingface.co/genshiai-daichi/baberu-ocr) by genshiai-daichi.)

Bundled libraries, ported code, and runtime-downloaded models are listed with their licenses in [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).
